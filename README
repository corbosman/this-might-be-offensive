These are the steps you need to follow to get a working
development site up and running on your local server.

Checkout the tree, setup a database + db user, import
data, schema's first, gzip -D the backups in the 0.1 tag
and then import those dumps too.

Create a new file in the 'web/admin' directory and call
it '.config' - this is where you will store your
database credentials and eventually other config info.

The file should resemble an .ini file, and look something
like this:

-[Start Below]-------------------------------------
[tmbo]
database_host = "localhost"
database_user = "bob"
database_pass = "my_password_is_hard"
database_name = "name_of_the_database_to_use"
-[End Above]---------------------------------------

There are a few dependencies for the site, the only
packages it should depend on now are ImageMagik, perl 
and php. The site has perl scripts which require the 
following modules:

DBI
File::Copy
Archive::Zip
Image::Size
ConfigReader::Simple

That should be all, if you get stuck or have any
questions, then just ask on the mailing list or in the
IRC channel and someone will be glad to help.
