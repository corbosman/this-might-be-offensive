april 1997:
	on a whim, i register themaxx.com and the site is born.

february 2000:
	andre writes a file upload widget in perl for a work project. he and a friend are stress testing it, uploading weirder and weirder images. he sees the entertainment value of it and launches filepile.

	i register for a filepile account.

september 2001:
	i upload my first file to filepile on september 9th. (the suck knob.)
	themaxx.com serves 11,300 pages.

sometime before april 2002:
	filepile goes private. if you have an account you're in, if not you're out.

february 2003:
	i write a perl script to pull images from filepile and feed them to my screensaver. i then remember that i don't use a screensaver, and even if i did, these are not the sorts of images i want appearing full screen without warning. with andre's permission, i start displaying the images at themaxx.com under the heading "the file pile thingy".
	themaxx.com serves 26,000 pages.

march 2003:
	themaxx.com serves 140,000 pages.

june 2003:
	i catch a bunch of flak from pilers who freak out when they find out about it. i turn it off. this will not be the last time.

	pilers who use themaxx.com encourage me to turn it back on.
	
	filepile doesn't want any attention, so the file pile thingy is resurrected under its new name, "[ this might be offensive ]".
	
september 2004:
	i'm receiving frequent requests and inquiries about how to contribute files, and i begin adding features. people can now upload, comment, and vote at themaxx.com, independent of filepile.
	themaxx.com serves 2.7 million pages.

january 2005:
	themaxx.com has over 1400 registered users.
	tension between pilers and maxxers grows. maxxers express pile envy and accuse pilers of being elitist pricks; pilers express uneasiness about [tmbo] (to put it politely) and taunt maxxers about their outsider status.

january 27th, 2005:
	andre sends me an instant message and tells me he thinks it's getting out of hand. people are bugging him about it. i'm at work and can't devote any attention to it. i unplug the filepile connection for the last time.

february, 2005:
	themaxx.com serves 18.2 million pages.
