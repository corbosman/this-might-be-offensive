			There's been a bit of confusion lately about what the rules are around here, so in the interest of clarity we've compiled the following list:
			<ol>
				<li>Don't be retarded.</li>	
			</ol>
			
			Please refer to this list when you have doubts about whether something you're about to do is inappropriate. Failure to observe these rules may result in account termination.

			We all agree that tsunamis, war, car crashes and mariah carey are bad. It's a question of whether you want to see the pics. Vote [this is good] to praise the uploader. vote [this is bad] to discourage.

		<p>We like your cat. Really we do. But we just can't take all 74 pictures of cuddly at once; Warm and fuzzy in such a high dosage quickly becomes hot and hairy, and then spontaneous human combustion. We don't want that. So there's a limit on how much you can upload.</p>
		
		<p>The upload limit is based on the number of good and bad votes you've received. The higher your good:bad ratio, the more files you're allowed to upload in a 24 hour period. (Just because you can doesn't mean you should.)</p>
